## Background

Heighliner Cloud's resource (application, stacks, team, etc.) management base on an organization. Therefore, we have to add organization's name in the URL to identify each other.

## Routes Define

Directory `[organization]` is organization's name placeholder in URL implemented by [Dynamic Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes).


**Every page related to an organization should place under `[organization]` directory.**
